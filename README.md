# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run start project with:
### `npm start`

### FOOTBAll-WORLD-CUP-SCOREBOARD
Here you get a frontend application developed for live football matches with options
<br/>
#1 Create Match <br/>
#2 update score for home and away team<br/>
#3 end running game(once a game is ended is wont show in the list to update scores)<br/>
#4 See matches summaries sorted by total score, if scores are the same 2 matches are sorted based on created time. <br/>

### storage solution
I have used Dexie for collection to store the data in structured format.
